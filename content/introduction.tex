Edited in Github and again. Hello world.

This is the \LaTeX{} template for my master thesis this year. I will fill
it with blindtexts and explanatory comments so that it is reusable for
everyone. It will hopefully compile warningless in the end. The following
software is needed to get it to compile:
\begin{itemize}
  \item LaTeX (should be somewhat newer than 2009)
  \item biber
  \item all the packages found in \emph{preamble/packages.tex}
  \item Latexmk for compilation (this is actually not needed, but
  recommended. This template comes with a .latexmkrc file to handle the
  compilation) 
\end{itemize}
I will try to use as many text elements in the blind texts as possible,
like inline equations, multiline equations, figures, multiple figures and
so on. Whenever I encounter a new situation while writing on the actual
thesis, I will add the stuff to this template as well.
The source code will be available on github always. You are not only
allowed but encoureged to fork the project and add useful stuff to it. I
might then integrate it in the actual template, if I find it useful.
The following text will be blindtexts only. If anybody is interested in the
actual thesis, feel free to contact me and I can send you a copy of the
PDF. However, it will not be finished before October this year.

Have fun with it! \\
